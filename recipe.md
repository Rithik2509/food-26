Step:1
Firstly, boil the basmati rice in plenty of boiling salted water.Remove the root end of the pak choi and chop it roughly. Place the pak choi in a frying pan with a drizzle of oil and a clove of unpeeled garlic. Toss the cabbage over a fairly high heat for 5 minutes.

Step:2
Now prepare the teriyaki sauce.  Put the soy sauce in a small pan. Add the sugar, mirin and grated ginger. Mix with a whisk and leave it to cook over a gentle heat until the sugar has melted. The resulting sauce will be slightly thick: this is teriyaki sauce.

Step:3
Carefully remove any pin bones from the salmon using special fish tweezers. If necessary, cut your fillets into suitably sized portions.  Remember not to remove the skin.  

Step:4
Put the salmon fillets in a dish and cover them with teriyaki sauce. Leave the salmon fillets to marinate in the fridge for about 30 minutes, covered with cling film. When the time is up, place the fillets, skin side down, in a non-stick frying pan. Cook over a medium-high heat for 3 minutes. Increase the cooking time to suit personal tastes and the size of the fillet. Lacquer the salmon fillets with the teriyaki sauce of the marinade and serve with the boiled rice and pan-tossed pak choi cabbage.
